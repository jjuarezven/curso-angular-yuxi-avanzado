    <p><strong>Diferencia entre $watch y $observe:</strong></p>
    <p>$observe() is a method on the Attributes object, and as such, it can only be used to observe/watch the value change of
        a DOM attribute. It is only used/called inside directives. Use $observe when you need to observe/watch a DOM attribute
        that contains interpolation (i.e., {{}}'s). E.g., attr1="Name: {{name}}", then in a directive: attrs.$observe('attr1',
        ...). (If you try scope.$watch(attrs.attr1, ...) it won't work because of the {{}}s -- you'll get undefined.) Use
        $watch for everything else.</p>
    <p>$watch() is more complicated. It can observe/watch an "expression", where the expression can be either a function or
        a string. If the expression is a string, it is $parse'd (i.e., evaluated as an Angular expression) into a function.
        (It is this function that is called every digest cycle.) The string expression can not contain {{}}'s. $watch is
        a method on the Scope object, so it can be used/called wherever you have access to a scope object, hence in a controller
        -- any controller -- one created via ng-view, ng-controller, or a directive controller a linking function in a directive,
        since this has access to a scope as well Because strings are evaluated as Angular expressions, $watch is often used
        when you want to observe/watch a model/scope property. E.g., attr1="myModel.some_prop", then in a controller or link
        function: scope.$watch('myModel.some_prop', ...) or scope.$watch(attrs.attr1, ...) (or scope.$watch(attrs['attr1'],
        ...)). (If you try attrs.$observe('attr1') you'll get the string myModel.some_prop, which is probably not what you
        want.)</p>
